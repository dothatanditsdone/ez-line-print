# ez-line-print
TLDR; remaps your numpad to a copy/paste on steroids

### When this program runs...
 - the user is presented with a GUI that is styled like a keyboard's number pad.
 - Program fetches the last used file, or a default file, or asks user for file (currently in the form of a csv)
 - csv elements are displayed on the gui (first element on Num 1 etc...)
 - user can 'shift' the elements using +/- to access elements that don't fit
 - the program will print whatever is displayed for the number a user presses at the cursor location
