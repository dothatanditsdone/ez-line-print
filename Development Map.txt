Auto Line Printer takes a csv file and maps each value to a custom mapping (most commonly the number pad).
There is a GUI that displays the current mapping configuration along with some basic settings.
The user presses the appropriate key that is mapped to the desired value and the program prints that value to the user's desired location.

1. Check watch folder for file.
   1. Read file
2. Else
   1. Ask for file

1. Read File.
2. Each element gets assigned to a key (typically numberpad, will attempt to build support for alternatives, personally I use Logitech G-13 gaming pad)
3. Elements that don't fit the number of alloted keys are accessed in increment/decrement keys (either additional key or modified key to increment/decrement by the # of alloted keys. For example, with the num pad, the '+' key will shift the elements assigned to keys up by one, a modified '+' key press will shift the elements up by 9)
  3a. If a row of the CSV has less elements than alloted keys, program loads as many elements of the next line as possible.

1. Draw GUI
